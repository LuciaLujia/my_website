<h1>GDP components over time and among countries</h1>
<p><br/>
At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a>.</p>

We first tidy up the data, as it is in wide format. Furthermore, we divide by <code>1e9</code> to express all figures in billions and rename the indicators into something shorter.</p>

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in the dataframe, we calculate it given its components discussed above.</p>

As we can see, the % difference of the two GDPs is in most cases around 0, i.e. both GDPs are in most cases approximately the same.</p>

First, let’s have a look at the net export proportion. In India and the United States, there is a trend towards higher imports as opposed to lower exports. For Germany, we can see the opposite effect, meaning that its net exports are growing at a higher rate than its overall GDP.</p>
<p>Regarding the proportion of gross capital formation, i.e. investments, we can see that there is a sharp rise in India in the 2000s. In the US, the proportion of GCF is also slightly rising, whereas the proportion in Germany dropped.</p>
<p>The proportion of Government expenditure is quite steady in India and Germany, whereas it dropped in the US.</p>
<p>Finally, household expenditure dropped significantly in India (with the investments going up), wheres they are steady in Germany and rising in the US.</p>
<p>All in all, we can conclude the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proportions in Germany are quite steady, with its net exports rate rising</li>
<li>In India, businesses are more and more investing, while the household expenditure rate drops</li>
<li>While government expenditure rates drop, households and businesses (have to) invest more in the US. This can be well explained by the rise of neo-liberalism and a lower influence of the public sector</li>
</ul>
